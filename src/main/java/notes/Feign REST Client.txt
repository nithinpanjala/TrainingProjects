Feign REST Client
- OpenFeign which is a declarative REST client.
- Originally Netflix developed Feign, but as they stopped supporting the     library, it is now a community-driven project and is called OpenFeign.
- It makes writing web service clients easier. 
- To use Feign create an interface and annotate it. 
- It has pluggable annotation support including Feign annotations and    JAX-RS annotations. 
- Feign also supports pluggable encoders and decoders
- Spring Cloud integrates Ribbon and Eureka to provide a load balanced   http client when using Feign.
